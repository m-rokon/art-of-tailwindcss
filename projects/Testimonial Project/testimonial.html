                        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                        12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR

                        of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
                        can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                        encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
                        can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                        assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
                        often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                        my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                        job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                        offers. 100% recommend! ”
